# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Prediction System

This is a **Machine Learning-based web application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a person is likely to have **Parkinson's Disease** based on voice measurement features.

The application uses a trained Machine Learning model and provides both **single-patient prediction** and **bulk CSV prediction** capabilities through an interactive web interface.

This project is part of my **Data Science & Machine Learning learning journey**, where I applied concepts such as **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, model serialization, and deployment**.

## 📊 Features

✔️ **User-Friendly Interface** – Enter patient voice measurements through an intuitive dashboard.

✔️ **Machine Learning Prediction** – Predicts the likelihood of Parkinson's Disease using a trained model.

✔️ **Bulk CSV Prediction** – Upload CSV files and generate predictions for multiple records at once.

✔️ **Automatic Preprocessing** – Applies scaling automatically if a saved scaler is available.

✔️ **Download Results** – Export prediction results as a CSV file.

✔️ **Interactive Dashboard** – Built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

✔️ **Cloud Deployment Ready** – Easily deployable on Streamlit Community Cloud.
